# Class 02

## How do I prep for today?
Have a solid grasp on scope and context.  Having a good grasp on these topics will allow for an easy transition into `call`, `apply`, and `bind`.  Work with these methods own your own, build a few demos, and review the demos in this directory for a good idea of how to position this lecture.
 
## What changed from yesterday? 
Today, you'll be adding a `package.json` and custom `npm` scripts for testing and linting. If you used `jest` to introduce testing on day 1, you'll now be able to dive into the intricacies of what `package.json` is, what it's used for, how to create it, and why it's used in NodeJS applications.

## What might students struggle with today? 
Students will struggle with the difference between `call` and `apply`.  Seperate problem domains for demo'ing each method will help solidify the usage of them.  Show students the MDN documentation for these methods and assist them in understanding how to properly read developer docs.

Students will likely be struggling with basic testing concepts.  During code review, it is a good idea to do a checkin on how students did with the testing of their previous lab assignment.  This should give you some insight on individual and class-wide challenges.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Discuss practical uses for `call` and `apply` and push students to do their own independent exploration of context.

## General comments
Have fun! Provide students with insight on what's to come the following lecture... get them excited about file system I/O!
