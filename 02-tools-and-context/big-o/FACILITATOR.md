# Class 05

## How do I prep for today?
Have a clear understanding of Big O Notation and how it's used.  Students will likely have no prior experience in determining the time and space complexities of an algorithim. It's often best to start with a discussion about obvious performance issues, such as nested loops, before diving into the details of Big O.

In addition to Big O, you'll be lecturing on the **List** data structure.  Feel free to take a look at the demos in this directory to help you prepare. The whiteboard challenges for the following week will be in relation to lists and arrays, which this lecture should aim to set students up for.

## What changed from yesterday? 
This is the first data structures class of the course.  Be sure to set student expectations and let them know that your data structures lectures will slowly, but surely, ramp up in complexity over the coming weeks.

## What might students struggle with today? 
Students will struggle with understanding the basics of Big O Notation and how to describe the complexities of an algorithm.  They'll also struggle with the process of whiteboarding.  Specifically, starting out with psuedocode and then moving into test conditions and the solution.  You'll want to stick around during their collaborative whiteboarding session to ensure everyone is moving in the right direction.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Students will misinterpret the Big O of a problem until they've had enough experience with it.  Keep an eye on their struggles and revisit the following week (or data structures lecture).

## General comments
It's DS&A day 1 - get students excited for what's to come!
