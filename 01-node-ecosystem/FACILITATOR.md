# Class 01

## How do I prep for today?
It's day 1!  Having a good handle on how much time you'll need to discuss each topic, and the transition into subsequent topics, is a key factor of a cohesive and efficient lecture.  Creating a "topics to cover" checklist, in GitHub or on the whiteboard, is a good way to keep yourself, and your students, on track and on topic.

Day 1 is all about introducing students to NodeJS. You'll want to have a solid understanding of the `module.exports` pattern, how to export a single function vs multiple methods, and how to do basic assertion testing. The only third party `npm` package you'll be working with is `jest` - let students know that you'll be discussing `npm` and `package.json` the following lecture.
 
## What changed from yesterday? 
N/A - it's the first day!

## What might students struggle with today? 
Students will struggle with getting acclimated to the assignment workflow. There may also be a few students who need assistance with basic computer setup (derived from the 401 prework).  Some students will not have Slack, NodeJS, NVM, or Homebrew (for MacOS) properly installed - be prepared to address these issues first thing in lab. Newer students and test-in's may need assitance with configuration and setup of Canvas.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Many students will not follow lab instructions correctly. You'll want to advise your TA's to do regular check-in's during the first couple of hours of lab. Students may have a hard time finding standard course resources, like the YouTube playlist and course repository. Be sure to put links to these resources in Slack and pin them for easy access.

## General comments
Start the day off with instructor, student, and TA introductions. Depending on the size of the class, take the time to personalize each student's "who am i and why am i here" comments with your own tie-in's back to the course content and/or future job opportunities.
